# NASA-polynomial
Main function is written in code.py.
#
Results are Cp0.csv, coefficients.csv and all graphs in file 'picture'
#
Run get_table.py could obtain the results for all molecules/ions. But, Cp0.csv and coefficients.csv need to be deleted before running this py file.
#
Use code in show_result.py to check result for one molecule/ion. Example for H2 has been written in this file. Remember to enter parameter 'save=0'.
#
Since the inputs of function are selected from database or website, here just set a simple test.
